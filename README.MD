# .Net core + docker test app.

Create a .NET Web API that takes ZIP-code as a parameter, then outputs city name, current temperature, time zone, and general elevation at the location with a user-friendly message. For example, “At the location $CITY_NAME, the temperature is $TEMPERATURE, and the timezone is $TIMEZONE”. Include documentation with any necessary build instructions and be prepared to discuss your approach.

- Use the Open WeatherMap current weather API to retrieve the current temperature and city name. You will be required to sign up for a free API key.
- Use the Google Time Zone API to get the current timezone for a location. You will again need to register a “project” and sign up for a free API key * with Google.

Full-Stack/Front End - Stretch goal (Optional)
